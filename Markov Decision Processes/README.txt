Running Algorithms
_________________
In order to run the MDP Value Iteration, Policy Iteration and QLearning algorithms I used the RL-Simulator.
I ran the following mazes: 3_multipleGoals1 (small maze), 8_big (big maze)

RL_Simulator CMU: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awm/rlsim/

Instructions to run code:
1. Install Java. Once java is installed and it is in path:
2. Extract RL_sim.zip to appropriate directory.
3. On windows: Start command prompt,
4. On Linux: Start shell.
5. Change directory to directory where files are extracted. Then Change directory to go in RL_sim directory.
6. Execute the command 'java -jar rl_sim.jar'
